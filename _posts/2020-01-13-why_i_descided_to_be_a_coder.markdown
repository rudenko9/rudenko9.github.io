  From the time I set to draft my very first college application letter, I have not had any solid idea - who I want to be. Who am I? Landed me with a Paralegal degree, Medical Coder CPC certificate and years of experience in various companies where I successfully proved my capabilities to achieve goals and go beyond what others were struggling with. Through the years I have pushed myself to be the best at what I was doing and was happy about my work. But, through the years, one thing annoyed me to the core of my bones. I wanted to see a person who built this or that application. I was always curious, why wouldn't this or that company consult with a medical professional or hire a developer with medical experience to build a system that would make ease one life and not make one struggle with itI always loved the technology but never thought the day would come when my patience will flip my world upside down and I would go on the other side of the technological process. I remember that system upgrade that triggered my nerve and I google a way to get myself into a developing career. At first, I was quiet about my decision. Then, when I start working on my skills, I realized that with these newly acquired skills I could change something. I could change my world, and if I am going to be lucky enough and my ideas will come to reality, one day I could help companies to thrive. And maybe one day, when a person like me, would use a system would think, I love this person who developed this product. I want to squeeze and hug this person so much that her eyeballs will pop.I have ambitions and I will succeed.
