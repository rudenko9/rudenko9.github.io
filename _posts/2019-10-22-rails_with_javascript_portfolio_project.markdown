JavaScript  Portfolio is my fourth project. Day by day I am getting closer to my goal to learn Javascript. I was very exited and I could not wait to start. Time passed by so quickly, I could not even believe it is time for yet another project. I was so used to Ruby that at first I did not know where to start and slowly but surely I got the hang of it, even though the project is totally different from all the previous ones.  It was very challenging and at some point hard to put everything together and make it work properly. 


My task was to create a Sigle Page Application. For the frontend, I had to use a combination of HTML, CSS and JavaScript, which will communicate with the backend API that is built in Ruby and Rails. 
Basically, what i did was that i have applied a JavaScript to my ruby on rails project. I created a web page for Hair Salon, where a user can log in with his/her email address and password. Also, user can sign up with the GitHub. A user can check the list of available Hair Stylists and book an appointment. I was using fetch() function to retrieve the data. To identify the errors causing our fetch() request to fail, I simply added the .catch() function to the end of our request. Through  .catch() we can catch the errors and log them to the console. Once an error is indentified, we can fix what is needed, and totally make fetch happen. 


I just did a proof read my text and pleasantly realized, I am a developer now. Nothing can stop me now. Cheers.
