*What is Sinatra?*

Sinatra is a free and open source software web application library and domain-specific language which is written in Ruby. It provides a faster and simpler alternative to Ruby frameworks such as Ruby on Rails.

*Requirements*

Basically, the task was to create an app in which a user can log in by using his credentials. User should be able to create an item or event; write, edit, or delete a review an item or event. The application must function in a way to allow a user, who wrote a review, to make edition and/or delete the text but the review should be lock from any editing capabilities to all other customers.

*Cars Reviews App*

Time flew so fast that I could not realize that it's time for the second project. I decided to create a Cars Reviews application. So, in my app, user can sign in using unique credentials. Also, a user can add a car name, add a model and then post a review for that car. As a default rule, I have restricted users' access so, user community has view only access to other users' reviews. A user can edit or delete only his/her own written review. 

*My Advise for the fellow students*

1. Make sure you go over all the material that is covered in the last week before the Sinatra project. Please note, almost everything that is covered in the past week will be in your project.
Learn, practice, repeat. 

2. Use Corneal -Sinatra app generator  https://github.com/thebrianemory/corneal

3.  Use Rack Flash  https://ididitmyway.herokuapp.com/past/2011/3/15/rack_flash_/
