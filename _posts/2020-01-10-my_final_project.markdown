 Looking back at 2019, I can easily say, it was a journey full of hardship, enormous challenges, the happiness of my accomplishments, sometimes frustrations, fascinating projects and ideas, the excitement of the glorious future and at the same time a daunting feeling during all these months of school. But now I can say out loud that I'm a coder! I made it, despite all the difficulties I had during the course of working on one or the other lab. I end up with a winner's feeling because I did it, I have solved many problems and coded everything correctly. That is the feeling which I won't be able to describe. Overjoyed.  I did it! I, with no prior experience of coding, finish my journey with Flatiron with my last project. And I know there is way more to learn and I'm ready for it. Bring it on.

 Choosing a Topic for my Project
 
 It was a little difficult for me to pick a nice, interesting topic. I wanted to create something new that can be useful for many people. So, as I'm a parent and we travel a lot, sometimes our kids get bored of hiking, visiting different historical places; therefore, they want to relax and just to play at the playground or visit some kids' activity or event. I designed the application for parents who travel with kids. So, I decided to create an application for parents where they can share the kids' events list with other parents. In this application, parents can choose as well as to create an event in which they are interested in or want to share. This application intended to help parents to find and attend an event or place to visit. I worked hard to help parents to spend quality time with their kids and to save their time on research of where to go and what to do.   

Building an Application

 Probably i will repeat myself as in every blog, but it was a very hard and surely much challenging task to create this application.  When I was building my previous project, I was dealing only with the front end, as I was applying JavaScript to my previous Ruby on Rails project. For my final project, I decided to start my application from scratch and to create everything differently from the previous projects. It was a huge pile of code I had to put together so it will work properly, a lot of debugging and figuring out why something is not working and connecting or not creating events at all, so on and so forth. The whole process took a while to set up everything nice and neat. The requirement was to use Ruby on Rails as a back end where I  created methods that would help me to create and save information to the database. This part of the project was not as hard as the front end.  The front end has been built on React and Redux. Lastly, the most challenging for me was to combine the front end and the back end together and keep tracking the state and the props. Trust me, to understand when to use state and props is a must.

Overall

 Overall, it was a very hard and huge pile of work for me. This project is exactly what I wanted it to be when I was building a concept on a piece of paper, I would like to say yes, but there is more work and editing can be done so it will be more professional and user-friendly. But I am proud of myself. There is totally new programming world waiting for me and I am coming strong and firm.
