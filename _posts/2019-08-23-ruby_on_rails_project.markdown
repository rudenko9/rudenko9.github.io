 Ruby on Rails is my third project. I would like to admit - it was hard, challenging, complicated,  and at the same time this project gave me a chance to learn new material I was looking for. I believe, it will get easier with time because I gained a lot of knowledge and experience before the projec, but I was wrong. there are way too many new material that i have to learn and get my hands on, material i am not even aware of. 

 So, I created a web application for a Hair Salon. In the application, user can log in with his/her email address and password. Also user can sign up with the GitHub. A user can check the list of available Hair Stylists and book an appointment. User can also add some comments to their appointments. One of the requirements was to create a scope method, so i created  an option where user can choose the Hair Stylist with most appointments. 

 Before writing a project i did a research and found that some people advise to use gem 'devise'. I can say, this gem is messing with your code  and complicate you life a lot in terms of coding. So i would recommend not to use this gem.
Try to understand the code you are writing, review your code in  rails console or rails c , it helps a lot to resolve the problems with code you are working on.
Good luck.
